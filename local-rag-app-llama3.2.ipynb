      "1. **Gwanghwamun Gate**: Located within Gyeongbokgung Palace, Gwanghwamun is the main and largest gate of the palace complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul. The gate was built during the reign of King Jeonjo (1724-1776) and is a symbol of traditional Korean architecture.\n",
      "2. **Dongdaemun Gate**: Originally built as an entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Dongdaemun Gate was renovated in 2011 to serve as the main gate of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). The DDP is a major urban development landmark and a hub for fashion, design, and culture in Seoul.\n",
      "3. **Seoraksan Gate**: Located at the entrance of Seoraksan National Park, this gate marks the beginning of a popular hiking trail that leads to the park's scenic trails and stunning views.\n",

The gates also serve as entrance points to various sites and attractions, offering visitors a glimpse into Korea's history, art, and traditions.\n"
